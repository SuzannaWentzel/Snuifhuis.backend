# Snuifhuis.backend
This is the code that, if running, functions as a backend for our Student House (Het Snuifhuis) website.

## Description
This project is built with (among other things) Node.js, parse-express and GraphQL, and is linked to a MongoDB database and a Vue.js frontend.

## Installation
Run the following command to initialize the Node.js environment: 
``` 
npm install 
```
Set your environment variables linking to your own MongoDB collections and create your own hash key in a file called nodemon.json.

Then run the following command to start this backend:
``` 
npm start 
```
